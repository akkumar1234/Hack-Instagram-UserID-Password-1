**Disclaimer**: This project is strictly for **educational purposes only**. The author, **Mohammad Usman E Gani**, is not responsible for any misuse or illegal activities conducted using this project. Please use this tool responsibly and within the boundaries of the law.

## Overview

**Hack-Instagram-UserID-Password** is a phishing-based project that demonstrates how user credentials can be captured by mimicking the original Instagram login page. The project serves as a learning tool to understand the security risks and vulnerabilities associated with phishing attacks.

This project is NOT intended for malicious purposes but rather to educate users on how such attacks can occur, so they can better protect themselves against similar threats.

## How It Works

1. **Phishing Technique**: The project deploys a replica of the Instagram login page on a server.
2. **User Data Capture**: When a user enters their Instagram credentials (username and password) on this fake login page, the information is captured and stored.
3. **Redirection**: After the credentials are captured, the user is redirected to the actual Instagram login page.

## Installation & Setup

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohammedusmanegani/Hack-Instagram-UserID-Password.git
   cd Hack-Instagram-UserID-Password
   ```
2. Install Dependencies: Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. This may include a web server, database, and any required packages or libraries.

3. Deploy the Phishing Page:
	- Host the replica Instagram login page on your server.
	- Configure the server to capture and store the entered credentials.
	- Set up the redirection to the real Instagram login page after credentials are captured.

5. Run the Project: Start the server to deploy the phishing page.
